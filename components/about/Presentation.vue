          (it helps that my 2 parents were Software Engineers at the time). I
          liked to play games and most of all online mini-games where you had to
          come back every day to make progress. You usually had a profile that
          you could tweak if you knew how to edit the source code, and that's
          why

          so I started learning C++ and programmed my first, very simple, games.
          I absolutely loved it.

          Computer Science wasn't for people like me (as in, women) and that it
          was weird that I liked coding. But my heart was already set: I was
          determined to prove all of them wrong. I wanted and still want to show
          everyone that, yes,
          <span class="bold">
            it is possible to love coding AND also love things that would be

          and got into Telecom SudParis, an Engineering school known for being
          tech-oriented. There,
          <span class="bold"> I learned a lot about soft skills </span> like
          collaboration, communication, design, leadership etc. as I was
          involved in many school initiatives. In parallel,
